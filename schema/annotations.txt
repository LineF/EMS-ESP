I have Jumper JP1 closed but sometimes when I connect the device to the EMS bus it drives too much current to load the capacitors so that the RC300 gets too low voltage and reboots.
You can open JP1 and insert R7 to reduce the current for the initial load (perhaps try 47 or 100 Ohms).

With JP2 and JP3 you can select the supply voltage:
	- JP2 closed and JP3 open: configure your buck converter to 3.3V!
	  It directly supplys the Node-MCU. Selecting voltage too high damages the ESP8266!
	- JP2 open and JP3 closed: configure your buck converter to 5V.
	  The 5V will supply the gateway interface (LM393 etc) and the DS18B20.
	  The linear voltage regulator in the Node-MCU will provide the 3.3V for the ESP8266.

J3 and J4 provide connections for I2C sensors. I will try to connect an BMP180 air pressure sensor
and add the feature to the software - but that will take some time...
